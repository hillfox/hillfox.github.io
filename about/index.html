My name is Zhang Yonggang. I was bron in Liaoning Province, P.R.China. After getting my pPh.D. degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, I moved to Singapore and worked as a firmware engineer in Hewlett-Packard.

Now, I am working in Seagate Singapore as a staff control firmware engineer.
