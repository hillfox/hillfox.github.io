Today, I learned some basic stuff on markdown.  I started to use Markdown when I use Github to manage my tech blogs. 

I got some basic introduction on Markdown language from Wikipedia and understand why so it is pupolar on document writing and blog platforms. 

The Markdown Editor I am using is Typora, which is a WYSIWYG. The application can be downloaded from [https://typora.io/](https://typora.io/)

The tutorial I have gone through is from [www.markdowntutorial.com](www.markdowntutorial.com)

Till now, I have not started on the more advanced topics. But I am ready to use it!

The study note,  _learn Markdown.doc_, is available at a project named **Tech_learning**. I will keep adding new notes on that file.
