Today, I created a new repo, servotools_git. In this repo, I implemented a mechanism to automatically update the tools (or any other files) with Git.  
The Git commands are run under Cygwin environment in Windows. What's more, a simple bash shell script is crested to run these Git commands. 
Futhermode, this shell script is run automatically by creating a bat file  in Windows and setting up a task in Taskscheduler.
To Summary, in this repo, the techniques involved are Git, Bash shell scripts, bat file and Taskscheduler task.
